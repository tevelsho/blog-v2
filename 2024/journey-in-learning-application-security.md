# Journey In Learning Application Security

Some stuff that this blog covers is:

* Learning paths that I used to learn web application security
* Information/Notes on SQL Injection, Authentication, Path traversal, Command Injection, Access Control, File Upload Vulnerabilties, SSRF, JWT Attacks, XSS (etc)
* New technologies used and learnt
* Other interesting information

## <mark style="color:orange;">Learning Avenues</mark>

1. [<mark style="color:orange;">PortSwigger's Web Academy</mark>](https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-topics)

One of the best ways I used to learn more about different web related attacks is through this course . The Web Security Academy is a **free** online training center for web application security. It covers both **Server & Client side related web attacks (incl. notes and labs)**. This course topics also ranges from **beginner to advanced** such as Web cache poisoning.\
\
PortSwigger also offers a certification on one of the most used tools for penetration testing of web applications. Check out my blog on my preparation, notes and tips [<mark style="color:orange;">here</mark>](https://xxx).

2. [<mark style="color:orange;">TryHackMe (THM)</mark>](https://tryhackme.com/r/hacktivities)

Another avenue I used is THM which is another valuable platform for learning about cybersecurity, particularly in the realm of practical, hands-on experience. THM provides a gamified learning environment with various rooms and challenges that cover a wide range of topics, including **web application security**, **networking**, and **digital forensics**. One of the standout features of THM is its emphasis on **real-world scenarios**, where users can apply their skills in a simulated environment.\
\
This makes it an excellent platform for both beginners looking to get started in cybersecurity and more experienced individuals seeking to enhance their skills.

3. [<mark style="color:orange;">HackTheBox (HTB)</mark>](https://academy.hackthebox.com/dashboard)

HTB is another popular platform in the cybersecurity community, known for its challenging and **realistic virtual labs**. HTB provides a platform for users to practice their penetration testing skills in a controlled environment, featuring machines with vulnerabilities that users must exploit to gain access.\
\
HTB offers a range of machines with varying difficulty levels, from beginner-friendly to advanced, catering to users of all skill levels. This platform is highly regarded for its realistic challenges, which provide valuable hands-on experience for those looking to enhance their penetration testing skills.\
\
It also features an active community where users can collaborate, share knowledge, and discuss techniques and solutions to challenges.

## <mark style="color:orange;">Useful Resources</mark>

These are some useful resources available that are open-source and have the possibility to help in CTFs or pen-testing.

1. [<mark style="color:orange;">OWASP Top 10</mark>](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)

Despite this not being a tool, the **OWASP Top 10** is very important to keep up with it! It is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security.

2. [<mark style="color:orange;">PayloadsAllTheThings</mark>](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master)

A list of extremely useful payloads and bypass for Web Application Security and Pentest/CTF.

3. [<mark style="color:orange;">HackTricks</mark>](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/)

A comprehensive online resource that provides a wide range of hacking and cybersecurity-related tips, tricks, techniques, and tools. It covers various topics such as penetration testing, exploitation, privilege escalation, reverse engineering, and more.
