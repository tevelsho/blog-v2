# Journey In Learning Application Security

Some stuff that this blog covers is:

* Learning paths that I used to learn web application security
* New technologies used and learnt
* Other interesting information

## Learning Avenues

1. [<mark style="color:orange;">PortSwigger's Web Academy</mark>](https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-topics)

One of the best ways I used to learn more about different web related attacks is through this course . The Web Security Academy is a **free** online training center for web application security. It covers both **Server & Client side related web attacks (incl. notes and labs)**. This course topics also ranges from **beginner to advanced** such as Web cache poisoning.\
\
PortSwigger also offers a certification on one of the most used tools for penetration testing of web applications. Check out my blog on my preparation, notes and tips [<mark style="color:orange;">here</mark>](https://xxx).

2. [<mark style="color:orange;">TryHackMe (THM)</mark>](https://tryhackme.com/r/hacktivities)

Another avenue I used is THM which is another valuable platform for learning about cybersecurity, particularly in the realm of practical, hands-on experience. THM provides a gamified learning environment with various rooms and challenges that cover a wide range of topics, including **web application security**, **networking**, and **digital forensics**. One of the standout features of THM is its emphasis on **real-world scenarios**, where users can apply their skills in a simulated environment.\
\
This makes it an excellent platform for both beginners looking to get started in cybersecurity and more experienced individuals seeking to enhance their skills.

3. [<mark style="color:orange;">HackTheBox (HTB)</mark>](https://academy.hackthebox.com/dashboard)

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/a56fw7h8a2aa1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>&#x3C;3</p></figcaption></figure>

HTB is another popular platform in the cybersecurity community, known for its challenging and **realistic virtual labs**. HTB provides a platform for users to practice their penetration testing skills in a controlled environment, **featuring machines with vulnerabilities that users must exploit to gain access**.\
\
HTB offers a range of machines with **varying difficulty levels**, from beginner-friendly to advanced, catering to users of all skill levels. This platform is highly regarded for its realistic challenges, which provide valuable hands-on experience for those looking to enhance their penetration testing skills.\
\
It also features an active community where users can collaborate, share knowledge, and discuss techniques and solutions to challenges.

## Useful Resources

These are some useful resources available that are **open-source** and have the possibility to help in CTFs or pen-testing.

1. [<mark style="color:orange;">OWASP Top 10</mark>](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)

Despite this not being a tool, the **OWASP Top 10** is very important to keep up with it! It is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security.

2. [<mark style="color:orange;">PayloadsAllTheThings</mark>](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master)

A list of extremely useful payloads and bypass for Web Application Security and Pentest/CTF.

3. [<mark style="color:orange;">HackTricks</mark>](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/)

A comprehensive online resource that provides a **wide range of hacking and cybersecurity-related tips**, **tricks**, **techniques**, and **tools**. It covers various topics such as penetration testing, exploitation, privilege escalation, reverse engineering, and more.

## Labs: Practical Application

One of the most effective ways to enhance your skills in web application security is through hands-on practice in a controlled environment (e.g. HTB/THM/Portswigger). However,  this section introduces two popular labs, **Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)** and **OWASP Juice Shop**, which provide vulnerable web applications for testing and learning purposes.&#x20;

These labs s**imulate real-world scenarios and contain various vulnerabilities**, making them ideal for practicing different attack techniques and understanding how to mitigate them.

**DVWA** and **Juice Shop** differ from **PortSwigger's Web Academy**, T**ryHackMe (THM)**, and **HackTheBox (HTB)** by offering a more **focused** and **practical approach** to learning web application security. While the other platforms provide theoretical knowledge and simulated challenges, DVWA and Juice Shop allow users to directly interact with and exploit vulnerabilities in real-world-like applications, providing a more hands-on and immersive learning experience.

1. [<mark style="color:orange;">DVWA</mark>](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA)

DVWA is a PHP/MySQL web application that is intentionally designed to be vulnerable. It contains various security vulnerabilities, ranging from **low to high severity**, such as **SQL injection**, **XSS**, **CSRF**, and more. DVWA is an excellent tool for beginners to practice and understand the fundamentals of web application security. It provides a safe environment to experiment with different attacks and learn how to secure web applications against them.

2. [<mark style="color:orange;">OWASP Juice Shop</mark>](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/)

Juice Shop is another vulnerable web application developed by the **Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)**. It is a modern and feature-rich web application with a wide range of security vulnerabilities.&#x20;

Juice Shop is designed to be realistic, **mimicking a modern e-commerce application** with challenges related to **authentication**, **access control**, **cryptography**, and more. Juice Shop is suitable for both beginners and advanced users, offering a challenging yet educational experience in web application security.

In conclusion DVWA and Juice Shop offer valuable learning experiences for anyone interested in web application security.&#x20;
